## Project Overview
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy, we were presented with a collaborative project where the team was completely free to reign. The aim was to demonstrate ability to conduct research, plan, design and build a full-stack application to either provide a service or solve a problem, within 10 days. As a group, we focused on creating a sustainabile solution which solves the global challenge of Food Waste.
<hr/>

"<b>In the UK alone, it's estimated that we throw away around 9.5 million tonnes of food waste annually.</b>"

**WHY?**

- Food is not used in time (Passed a date label or is judged as not usable
- Improper storage (By production or consumer)
- Overbuying
- Over-preparation (Higher quantities are prepared, or served than necessary)

DigitalFridge -  A free application that allows you to easily track, organize and manage the food in your home! **Make an account**, **add items** to "Food List", **create a fridge** *(Now with shared fridges)* and **start stocking**, just like your physical fridge! Popping to the store?...No more pen & paper, simply transfer items to the grocery List - *Let us do the hard work*.

## Setup & Instructions

### Backend - Server-side

*Please make sure that you have Java 17 installed to run DigitalFridge Backend*
1. Clone this repository by typing the following command into your terminal:
   git@github.com:Carla022/w12_Capstone_Project_DigitalFridge.git
2. Once the repository has been cloned, open the 'backend' folder in Visual Studio code (VSC) + run it.
3. The endpoints can be accessed via an API platform such as Postman or the browser at https://localhost:8080/{endpoint}

### Frontend - Client-side

1. When the repository has been cloned, open the 'frontend' folder in terminal -> type the command: 'npm install' or (npm i)
2. Once that has run, type the command: 'code .' to open in Visual Studio code (VSC)
3. In Visual Studio code (VSC) built in terminal, type the following commands:

- npm install react-router-dom@6

4. Once the packages have been installed, open the react app in browser using the command: 'npm start'

*Please note, the front-end application should run on ‘localhost:3000’ unless you have another application running on this host - if so, you will have the option to run this on another host i.e. localhost:3001. This will not affect the running of the project.*

## Project Structure

### Frontend

For this segment, the team created a React application to act as a front-end for our DigitalFridge project (built in the server-side sub-project). 

### Backend

This segment of the project involved building the DigitalFridge API for the user to interact with. Below you will find images of our 'Unified Modelling Language Diagram' and 'Entity Relationship Diagram'.

## Further Implementations

In the future, we would like to expand this project by implementing the following functionalities/features:

- Freezer & Pantry Management
- Ability to directly link with online shopping accounts
- Link a single fridge to multiple profiles (a household of 1 plus)
- Enable user to customise food categoty labels

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the Bright Network Technology Academy team, and a special shoutout to the trainers involved!
